Final project on Hartree-Fock calculations in Helium, which 
draws heavily from Computational Physics by Steven E. Koonin (1986),
Project III (p. 64-76), as detailed in TeX writeup.
Calculations are implemented in C++, plotting with Python scientific libraries.
Will be extended to systems with more electrons.
